Coding challenge


BACK END TEST:

1) Write a script that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "three" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print "five". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print "three-five."

2) Write a single function that determines whether or not an array key exists anywhere in a multi-dimensional array. (Assume the array can have an arbitrary number of dimensions.)

3) Create a form that accepts an image, and gives you an error if it's not jpeg or png, or if the file size is above 2 megs. After post, resize the image and display as a jpeg that fits into 400x300 without changing the aspect ratio (dimensions can be reduced if it's a different aspect ratio). Don't use an all in one library solution.

add answers to a git repo and either make public and send the link or share with "valan" on github or bitbucket
